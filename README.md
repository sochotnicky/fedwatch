fedwatch
========

Library for watching fedmsg messages and running arbitrary scripts in a nice way

Think of fedwatch as simple converter from fedmsg JSON messages into shell
arguments for scripts. 

fedwatch is like inetd for fedmsg - it listens for incoming fedmsg
traffic and spawns user-supplied executables for handling matching
messages.  It improves efficiency of scripts for reacting on fedmsg
events and makes them easier to write.

Dependencies
============
* fedmsg (duh!)
* python-dpath (https://github.com/akesterson/dpath-python)

Usage
=====

To use fedwatch you will need to create a configuration file (by default read
from /etc/fedwatch.conf) and scripts that are to be run when messages of
interest arrive (by default /etc/fedwatch.d). 

When interesting message arrives, fedmsg converts JSON data into arguments for
shell scripts and runs each script in <em>script-dir</em> based on
configuration. First argument is always topic so that scripts can handle
different topics. 

Real life example of configuration file:

    {
        "org.fedoraproject.prod.git.receive": {
            "args": [
                "msg/commit/username",
                "msg/commit/repo",
                "msg/commit/branch",
                "msg/commit/rev",
                "msg/commit/summary"
            ]
        }
    }

Above configuration means fedwatch will be waiting for <em>git.receive</em>
topic and will pass 6 arguments to any scripts in <em>script-dir</em>:
  
  1. org.fedoraproject.prod.git.receive (topic)
  2. FAS username of commiter
  3. repository (package) name
  4. branch name
  5. revision (SHA hash of commit)
  6. commit summary (1st line of git commit)
